## Vanilla GANs
Vanilla GANs found in this project were developed based on the original paper [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) by Goodfellow et al.

These are trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), and learn to create hand-written digit images using a 1-Dimensional vector representation for 2D input images.

## Random Frameworks
    [Sony NN Console - not so impressive](http://dl.sony.com)
    [Azure ML STudio - quite impressive](https://studio.azureml.net/)
    [Sagemaker not bad](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
