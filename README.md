#  My Machine Learning Playground
Everything from 101 Linear and Logistic Regression, to Neural Networks on Google TensorFlow, to GAN's on PyTorch

[Check out this blog post](https://medium.com/ai-society/gans-from-scratch-1-a-deep-introduction-with-code-in-pytorch-and-tensorflow-cb03cdcdba0f) for an introduction to Generative Networks. 

I may add various bookmarks here later

## Vanilla GANs
Vanilla GANs found in this project were developed based on the original paper [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) by Goodfellow et al.

These are trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), and learn to create hand-written digit images using a 1-Dimensional vector representation for 2D input images.

## DCGANs
Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) in this repository were developed based on the original paper [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) by Radford et al.

These are trained on the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) datasets. They use 3 dimensional representations for images (length x height x colors) directly for training.
