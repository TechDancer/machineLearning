Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening.
A beautiful sight, happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away, is the blue bird.
Here to stay, is a new bird.
He sings a love song.
As we go along.
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow, we can build a snowman.
And pretend that he is Parson Brown.
He'll say, &quot;Are you married?&quot;
We'll say, &quot;No, man.&quot;
But you can do the job, when you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream, by the fire.
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made.
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow, we can build a snowman.
And pretend that he's a circus clown.
We'll have lots of fun, with Mr. Snowman.
Until the other kiddies, knock him down.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we drink, by the fire.
To face unafraid.
The plans that we've made.
Walking in a winter wonderland.
