Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
Been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf, tonight
So, stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

Oh, say, Candy and Ronnie
Have you seen them yet?
Oh, 'cause they're so spaced out,
G-G-G-Gaga and the Jets (Hey, that's not the words!)
Ooh, they're weird and wonderful
Ooh, Elton he's really keen (She's keen)
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
I read it in a magazine
Oh, oh (Come, on!)
G-G-G-Gaga and the Jets!

Hey kids, why don't plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Gaga makes them ageless (Ha, ha!)
We survive, let us take ourselves along (Whoo!)
Where we fight, our parents, out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Say, Candy and Ronnie
Have you seen them yet?
Oh, 'cause they're so spaced out
G-g-g-Gaga and the Jets
Ooh, Elton it's sweet and wonderful
Ooh, Elton he's really keen
He's got electric boots, a mohair suit
I read it in a magazine
Oh, oh (Come, on!)
E-E-E-Elton/G-G-G-Gaga and the Jets!

Gaga, mother (Oh, ho!)
I love you, baby (Yeah-ha!)
