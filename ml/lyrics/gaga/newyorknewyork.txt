Start spreading the news
I am leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I want to wake up in that city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

These little town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York

If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York

New York, New York
I want to wake up in that city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
A number one
Top of the list
Man of the hour

All these little town blues
All melting away
Right through the very heart of it
In old New York

If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York, New York
