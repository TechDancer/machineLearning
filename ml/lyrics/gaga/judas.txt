I'm in love with Judas, Judas
I'm in love with Judas, Judas


Judas! Judas! Judas! Judas!
Judas! Judas! Judas! Gaga

When he calls to me I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

I'm in love with Judas, Judas
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

Judas! Judas! Judas! Judas!
Judas! Judas! Judas! Gaga

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his crooked way
I've learned love is like a brick you can
Build a house or sink a dead body

I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

I'm in love with Judas, Judas
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

In the most Biblical sense
I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense
I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me if offenced,
Or wear a condom next time

I wanna love you,
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue,
And Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

I'm in love with Judas, Judas
I'm in love with Judas, Judas

Judas! Judas! Judas! Judas
Judas! Judas! Judas! Gaga
