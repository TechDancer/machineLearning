I met a girl in East LA
In floral shorts as sweet as May
She sang in eights in two Barrio chords
We fell in love, but not in court

Manos
Manos

Ah America Americano
Ah America Americano
Ah America Americano
Ah America Americano

Mis canciones son de la revolución
Mi corazón me duele por mi generación

&quot;My songs are of the revolution
My heart hurts for my generation&quot;]

If you love me, we can marry, on the west coast
On a Wednesday, en un verano, en agosto

&quot;...in summer, in August&quot;]

I don't speak your, I don't speak your language oh no
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesús Cristo

Ah America Americano
Ah America Americano

I will fight for, I have fought for how I love you
I have cried for, I will die for how I care
In the mountains, las campanas están sonando
Todos los chicos (chicas) y los chicos (chicas) están besando

&quot;...the bells are ringing
All the boys (girls), and the boys (girls) are kissing&quot;]

I don't speak your, I don't speak your language oh no
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesús Cristo
I don't speak your, I don't speak your Americano
I don't speak your, I won't speak your Jesús Cristo

Ah America Americano
Ah America Americano
Ah America Americano
Ah America Americano

Don't you try to catch me
Don't you try to catch me
No! No! No! No!
I'm living on the edge of
Living on the edge of the law, law, law, law

Don't you try to catch me
Don't you try to get me
No! No! No! No!
Don't you try to catch me
I'm living on the edge of the law, law, law, law
