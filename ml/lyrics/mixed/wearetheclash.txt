Punk rockers, hip-hoppers
Brit poppers, show stoppers
Beboppers, hair droppers
Are you ready to sing?

Right wing, left wing           
I want something
Easy to say         
Bout what do you think


We ain't gonna be treated like trash
We got one thing
We are the Clash
What?  
We are the Clash
It's like a patch
You can strike that match


With my guitar now
The Cuban's last dance
I see them where they beatin' from
And the injuries stay

Beating on a drum
Did they tell them 'take it in'
Got the nervous sort of feelin'
Where the fat boy blew


We ain't gonna be treated like trash
We got one thing
We are the Clash
That's right
We are the Clash
It's like a patch
You can strike that match


Home fires burnin'
In motorcycle city
The rockin' gods will choose
If I'm worthy to live (rock rock clash city rockers)
The first to next engine
In jail at forty-six
And there's no more between ya..
To imitate respect


We ain't gonna be treated like trash
We got one thing
We are the Clash
Don't take no shit
We are the Clash
Do ya hear me?
It's like a patch
You can strike that match
