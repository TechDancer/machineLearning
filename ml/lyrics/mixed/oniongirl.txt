Make the bad boys cry

She'd let you know all her secrets
She'd let you know all her mind

But instead you acted like you were the best
You've been all that now she wants to forget
But you can't shut her mouth
Can't let her down
(Can't let her down)

It used to be so dark
He went away and she just fell apart
She has gone blind to see
Onion girl, make the bad boys cry
(Onion girl, you rule the world)
Make the bad boys cry
(Onion girl, you rule the world)
Make the bad boys...

She just needed you being her lover
Even when loving you was so hard

You have said that she was not enough
That she, that she should not move one
But she is getting stronger
She is getting higher
You can't stop her

(You can't stop her...)

It used to be so dark
He went away and she just fell apart
She has gone blind to see
Onion girl, make the bad boys cry
(Onion girl, you rule the world)
Make the bad boys cry
(Onion girl, you rule the world)
Make the bad boys...

Sweet revenge
It never felt so great
Now you can watch me dancing
While you're fading away

You can break me down
But baby I can stand
Now you can applaud me and say
&quot;I'll never let you away&quot;

It used to be so dark
He went away and she just fell apart
She has gone blind to see
Onion girl, make the bad boys cry
(Onion girl, you rule the world)
Make the bad boys cry
(Onion girl, you rule the world)
Make the bad boys...cry
