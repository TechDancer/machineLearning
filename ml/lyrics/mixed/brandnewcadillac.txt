Driiiiiiiive!!!

My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
Yes she did!
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
She said, &quot;Hey, come here, Daddy!&quot;
&quot;I ain't never comin' back!&quot;

Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
C'mon, sugar, just come on back to me
She said, &quot;Balls to you, Big Daddy.&quot;
She ain't never coming back!

Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
Oh c'mon, just hear my plea
She said, &quot;Balls to you, Daddy.&quot;
She ain't coming back to me

Baby, baby drove up in a Cadillac
I said, &quot;Jesus Christ! Where'd you get that cadillac?&quot;
She said, &quot;Balls to you, Daddy.&quot;
She ain't never coming back!
