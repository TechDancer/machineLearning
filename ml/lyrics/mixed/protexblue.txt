standing in the bog of a west end bar
guy on the right leaning over too far
money in my pocket gonna put it in the slot
open up the pack see what type i got

i didn't want to hold you
i didn't want to use you
protex, protex blue
all wanna do

it's a fab protective for that type of a girl
but everybody knows that she uses it well
it's the therapeutic structure i can use at will
but i don't think it fits my b.d. drill

sitting in a carriage of a bakerloo
erotica my pocket got a packet for you
advert on the escalator on my way home
i don't need no skin flicks, i wanna be alone

i didn't want to hold you
i didn't want to use you
protex, protex blue
all i wanna do

johnny, johnny
