Push, push, dance for the city life
Smoke, smoke, baby, like a motor bike
Take your trash to my junkyard site
Been in your skies, I will fly my kite

They keep singing west coast weather is better
But it don't matter cause I love you and I'll never let go
I'll never leave you, won't leave you
Cause you were made for me
I'll touch each color of you are my urban fantasy
It's not a question, it's obsession
You're the one for me
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York

Run run, red, gonna be the light
Hold your breath while we firefight
T-N-T, cause we're dynamite
Where are the choo-choo's running tonight?

They keep singing west coast weather is better
But it don't matter cause I love you and I'll never look down

I'll never leave you, won't leave you
Cause you were made for me
I'll touch each color of you are my urban fantasy
It's not a question, it's obsession
You're the one for me
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York

Can't wear leather in LA
Come with me baby in the fast lane
Can't wear leather in LA
Pump it baby in the fast lane
Can't wear leather in LA
Come with me baby in the fast lane
Can't wear leather in LA
Pump it baby in the fast lane

I'll never leave you, won't leave you
Cause you were made for me
I'll touch each color of you are my urban fantasy
It's not a question, it's obsession
You're the one for me
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
Me love you New York, love you New York
