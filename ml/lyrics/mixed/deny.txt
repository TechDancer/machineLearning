deny
you're such a liar
you won't know the truth if it hits you in the eye
deny
you're such a liar
you're selling your no-no all the time

an' you said we were going out
to the 100 club
then you said it ain't my scene
but then you turned up alone
then you turned up alone

then you said you'd given it up
gone an' kicked it in the head
you said you ain't had none for weeks
but baby i seen your arms
baby i seen your arms

do you think i'm a raving idiot?
just got off the boat
step in line, sign this form - you ain't got a hope
baby ain't got a hope - you ain't got a hope

what a liar - deny
what a liar
