yes, it's time for the dr. goebbels
show!

there's a tower in the heart of london
with a radio station right at the top
they don't make the city beat
they're making all the action stop

a long time ago there were pirates
beaming waves from the sea
but now all the stations are silent
'cos they ain't got a government license

wanna tell your problems
phone in from your bedsit room
having trouble with your partner
let us all in on the news

if you wanna hear a record
or get the word from Aidan Day 
he picks all the hits to play
to keep you in your place all day

capital radio
in tune with nothing
don't touch that dial
