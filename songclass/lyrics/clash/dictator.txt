Yes I am the dictator the more guns I got the better
Yes I am the liquidator I carry the old Beretta
You know there once was freedom
You know how dangerous that can be
The people used to dance &amp; sing
&amp; they used to run wild in the streets
But now I am the voice
Howling from your radio
From my armour plated Cadillac
You'll hear what I say goes

Yes I am the dictator I satisfy the U.S. team
I always do my killing in the woods &amp; keep the city gutters clean
Cos I need a few more dollars
For my fighter pilot to be free
To dive bomb on the population
If they go running wild in the streets
Yes I am that voice...etc

Yes I am the crusador I spent twenty years in exile
But now I am the invader &amp; I'm never never gonna die
Yes I am the dictator my name is on your ballot sheet
But until my box has your cross you know the form is incomplete
And you know........etc
