When they're young
All Little Monsters
Learn that they're scary
Ugly, stupid, shunned by Cupid
Overweight &amp; hairy

But every Monster needs to find
That secret deep inside
That transforms Dr. Jekyll into
Sexy, Mr. Hyde

All my Monsters are beautiful
Disco Stutiful
Square rootiful
Old cutiful

Monsters don't need implants
Or a bitching Monster car
Monsters only need to love
The Monsters, that they are

Ooh, yeah, yeah
Gaga, dada, jawa
Peace!
