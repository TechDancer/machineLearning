You make me feel so pretty,
When I'm not feeling, so cool today.
Yeah, you pull me out,
When you know that I'm afraid.
Something about you.
It dries up every tear in the way.
And when I trip myself,
On the sidewalk,
You put my boots back on me, babe.
'Cause you're my cowboy,
You're my everything.
And you know how to get me.

Sometimes, I'm feeling up.
Sometimes, I'm down.
You lift my feet up, off the ground.
Sometimes, I'm moving fast.
Sometimes, I'm slow.
You know, what'll make me go.
Sometimes, I am the happy girl, you love.
Sometimes, I don't feel good enough.
Sometimes,
Sometimes.
Oh, you're there, when I need you, sometimes.
When I need you, sometimes.

I ask myself these questions,
About you, that I cannot explain.
How you ride with me,
When you know that I'm to blame.
You proved your love, oh.
Don't need to hear the words, that you say.
But I know you'll say them, anyway.
Just to keep me feeling sane.
As my worries become yesterday.
Baby, you get me.

Sometimes, I'm feeling up.
Sometimes, I'm down.
You lift my feet up, off the ground.
Sometimes, I'm moving fast.
Sometimes, I'm slow.
You know, what'll make me go.
Sometimes, I am the happy girl, you love.
Sometimes, I don't feel good enough.
Sometimes,
Sometimes.
Oh, you're there, when I need you, sometimes.
When I need you, sometimes.

And my worries become yesterday.
'Cause, baby, know that I'm...
