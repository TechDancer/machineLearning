1, 2.
I think, I love you.
You got ripped jeans.
I'm only nineteen.
What do you wanna do?
You got your cigarette.
I got my headset.
We're two of a kind,
You're spades &amp; I'm diamonds,
And you know that you.

Yeah, you can see clearly, that I am the one you want.
But I must admit, that, I'm everything you're not.

Yeah, I am red, you are blue.
I'm old-school &amp; you're so new.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
When you're cool,
I like to burn.
I cut lines, so, wait your turn.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight.

Don't shoot.
My heart is on mute.
Our physical dreams, are only skin deep,
How do you wanna groove?
Bang, bang.
You hear my gun ring, oh.
Yeah.
Your mind, your deck, you're hidden.
I am all up inside your head.

Yeah, you can see clearly, that I am the one you want.
But I must admit, that, I'm everything you're not.

Yeah, I am red, you are blue.
I'm old-school &amp; you're so new.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
When you're cool,
I like to burn.
I cut lines, so, wait your turn.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight.

You won't forget me, when I'm gone.
This feels so good, it can't be wrong. 
I'd recommend, a one-night stand.
I know, we're just friends, but
You're my kind of man.
Just for tonight.
Just for tonight.
Just for tonight.

Even though, I'm red, you are blue.
I'm old-school &amp; you're so new.
I know, we could be great for tonight.
When you're cool,
I'll make it burn.
You'll never have to wait your turn.
Yeah, I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
Tonight, tonight.

Yeah, I am red, you are blue.
I'm old-school &amp; you're so new.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
When you're cool,
I like to burn.
I cut lines, so, wait your turn.
But I guess, I could forgive you, tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight.
