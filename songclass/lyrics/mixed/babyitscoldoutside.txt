Well, my lady.
It's been grand, but I think, I gotta go.
(No!)

I really can't stay.
(Baby, it's cold outside.)
I've got to go away.
(But, baby, it's cold outside.)
This evening has been.
(So happy that you dropped in.)
So, very nice.
(I'll hold your hands, they feel like ice.)

My mother will start to worry.
(Beautiful, what's the hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor.
(Listen to fire place roar.)
But really I'd better scurry.
Or maybe just a half a drink more.
(Put the record on, while I pour.)

But the neighbours might think.
(Baby, it's bad out there.)
Say, what's in this drink?
(There ain't any cabs out there.)
I feel as I'm in.
(Your eyes are better than sin.)
Some crazy spell.
(I love your hair it looks so swell.)

I'd rather say, &quot;No, no, no, sir.&quot;
(What if I move in closer?)
At least, I'm gonna say, that I tried.
(What's up with the hurt of my pride?)
I really can't stay.
Baby,
(Ah) Baby, it's cold outside.

I simply must go.
(Baby, it's cold outside.)
The answer is, &quot;No.&quot;
(But, baby, it's cold outside.)
I seen this welcome has been.
(How lucky that you dropped in.)
So, nice &amp; warm.
(Look out the window at that storm.)

My sister, will be suspicious.
(Gosh, your lips look delicious.)
My brother, will be there on the floor.
(Waves upon a tropical shore.)
My friends, oh, their minds are vicious.
(Gosh, your lips look delicious.)
Or maybe just a cigarette more.
(Never such a blizzard before.)

I've got to get home.
(Baby, you'll freeze out there.)
Why don't you lend me another coat?
(It's up to your knees out there.)
You've really been grand, but can't you see?
(Oh, how you do this thing to me.)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow.
(Think of my life long sorrow.)
At least, there will be plenty, implied.
(If you caught pneumonia &amp; died.)
I really can't stay.
Oh, oh.
(Ah) Baby, it's cold outside.
