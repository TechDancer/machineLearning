I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit
That makes me want to scream


So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

Write what you want
Say what you want 'bout me
If you wanna know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body


You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
(Do what you want) with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
(Do what you want) with my body


My bones hurt
From all the shows
But I don't feel the pain 'cause I'm a pro
I, I sink in
And then I'm ok,
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage


So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want (Ooh, do what you want don't stop let's party)
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

Write what you want
Say what you want 'bout me
If you wanna know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body


You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
(Do what you want) with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
(Do what you want) with my body


Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go (aah, aah)
I would fall apart (apart)
If you break my heart (ooh)
So just take my body (body)
And don't stop the party (


You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body (Do what you want, do what you want, OOH!)
(Do what you want) with my body
You can't stop my voice cause (my voice)
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body (Do what you want with me, Ooh)
(Do what you want) with my body












 Do what you want with my body, (Hey!) do what you want with my body...
