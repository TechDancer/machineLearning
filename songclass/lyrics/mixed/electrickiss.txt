We are a generation twisted, by a myth.
Confused &amp; ludicrous.
Holding on to love.
Consumed, by all the pleasures, that are mixed.
Alive with all the lips we've kissed,
And losing all control.

We're gonna start a resistance.
And we want independence.
We're gonna give the world some of this.

Electric Kiss.
I'm gonna change the world, with my lips.
One voice, forever.
We'll live together.
In peace, love, solitude, &amp; happiness.
Electric Kiss.

Fame is our felony,
We're so in love with it.
Some superstars &amp; masochists,
Who don't know, where to go.
But the poets,
And the fighters of our time.
Put down their weapons, in their rhymes.
And they know, what they must do.

They're gonna start a resistance.
And they want independence.
They're gonna give the world some of this.

Electric Kiss.
I'm gonna change the world, with my lips.
One voice, forever.
We'll live together.
In peace, love, solitude, &amp; happiness.

Electric Kiss.
I'm gonna change the world, with my lips.
Oh, one voice, forever.
We'll live together.
In peace, love, solitude, &amp; happiness.
Electric Kiss.
