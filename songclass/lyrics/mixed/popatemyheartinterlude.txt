-Where is it? Where is it, Kandy? Kandy?

-He ate it

-Yes, I don't believe you

-Look for yourself
Pop ate my heart

-I see

-He downed the whole thing
In one efficient gulp
Like a beautiful monster
Then, took off, into the city

-Oh, Kandy

-And, now, I just feel...I feel so...

-Empty?

-No...No

-Kandy?

-Free...I feel...Free

Huh!...

I need more to feed my...
Pop heart
Give me more
I want the music
Gaga. Fashion
Technology
Dance. New York
Music. Pop culture
I want The Fame
I can hear you
Can you hear me?
Pop pollution in front of me
And I want
We want
You deserve the future
My name is Lady Gaga
And this is my house
